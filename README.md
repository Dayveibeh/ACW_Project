# ACW_Project
I was given a collection of data from a company wishing to process its customer records for business purposes (acw_user_data.csv). The existing systems in-place at the company only export to a CSV file, and this is not in an appropriate format for analysis. I was given the task of preparing this data for further analyses by colleagues within the company, including representation changes, filtering, and deriving some new attributes / metrics for them.

The notebook shows the codes written for this task, the dataset is available and the outputs are attached as well.
